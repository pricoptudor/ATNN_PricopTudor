In this project i used:
-Double Deep Q Learning Agent with Experience Replay ,model with BatchNorm and LeakyReLu
-Multiple Game State Representations and 2 episode definitions

The best obtained agent is named A1L and is competitive with a heuristic method for the environment 
with 1 circle.In all environments,the Q Learning Agents easily outperforms the Random Agent.

Agents A1L,A4L,A6L and A7L are trained for 1 circle and have different policies,the best by far being A1L.
